# Training Invoice System Changes

## Overview
The training invoice system has been modified so that invoices are now generated and sent via email immediately when a user registers for training, rather than when they complete the training.

## Changes Made

### 1. Invoice Generation Timing
- **Before**: Invoices were generated when training was marked as completed
- **After**: Invoices are generated and sent immediately upon training registration

### 2. Modified Functions

#### `createBooking` (trainingController.js)
- Added invoice email sending immediately after invoice creation
- Updated booking confirmation email to mention that an invoice has been sent

#### `updateBookingStatus` (trainingController.js)
- Removed invoice generation from completion process
- Added note that invoices are now sent at registration time

#### `generateCertificate` (trainingController.js)
- Removed invoice generation from certificate generation process
- Updated certificate email to not include invoice attachments

#### `bulkImportParticipants` (trainingController.js)
- Modified to generate and send invoices at registration time instead of completion time

#### `generateMissingInvoices` (trainingController.js)
- Updated to send invoices via email when generating missing invoices

### 3. Email Content Updates

#### Invoice Email (`sendInvoiceEmail`)
- Updated subject line: "Invoice for Training Registration" instead of "Invoice for Training"
- Updated email content to reflect registration context
- Changed messaging to indicate payment confirms registration

#### Booking Confirmation Email (`sendBookingConfirmationEmail`)
- Added mention that an invoice has been sent for paid training events

#### Certificate Email (`sendCertificateEmail`)
- Removed invoice attachment (invoices are now sent at registration)
- Updated payment information section to reflect that invoice was sent at registration

### 4. Benefits of Changes

1. **Immediate Payment Request**: Users receive invoices right away, allowing for earlier payment processing
2. **Better Cash Flow**: Earlier invoice generation improves cash flow for the organization
3. **Clearer Communication**: Users know immediately what they need to pay for their registration
4. **Reduced Confusion**: No more waiting until completion to receive an invoice

### 5. Backward Compatibility

- Existing invoices in the system remain unchanged
- The `generateMissingInvoices` function can be used to generate invoices for existing bookings that don't have invoices
- All existing API endpoints continue to work as expected

### 6. Testing

To test the new system:

1. Create a new training event with a price
2. Register a participant for the training
3. Verify that an invoice is generated and sent via email immediately
4. Check that the booking confirmation email mentions the invoice
5. Mark the training as completed and verify no new invoice is generated

### 7. Error Handling

- If invoice generation fails during registration, the booking still succeeds
- If email sending fails, the invoice is still created but not sent
- All errors are logged for debugging purposes
