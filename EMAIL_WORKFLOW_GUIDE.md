## üéØ Best Practices

### Template Creation

‚úÖ **Use clear subject lines** - Include `{name}` for personalization
‚úÖ **Keep it concise** - People scan emails, not read them
‚úÖ **Add clear call-to-action** - What should they do next?
‚úÖ **Test placeholders** - Make sure `{name}` etc. work correctly
‚úÖ **Mobile-friendly** - Many people read on phones

### Automation Setup

‚úÖ **Start simple** - Begin with welcome email only
‚úÖ **Add delays** - Don't send all emails at once (space them out)
‚úÖ **Test before activating** - Send test email to yourself first
‚úÖ **Monitor logs** - Check Email Automations ‚Üí Logs to see what's sent
‚úÖ **Don't over-automate** - 2-3 automated emails per lead is enough

### Campaign Sending

‚úÖ **Segment your audience** - Use tags to target specific groups
‚úÖ **Timing matters** - Send newsletters on Tuesday/Wednesday mornings
‚úÖ **Track engagement** - Check open rates and clicks
‚úÖ **Don't spam** - Max 1-2 marketing emails per month
‚úÖ **Personalize** - Always use `{name}` placeholder
